<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Directional Drilling Service Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional System</li><li>Rotary Steerable System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Directional Drilling Service market encompasses two primary types: Conventional Systems and Rotary Steerable Systems. Conventional Systems utilize a downhole assembly with bent sub and mud motors to change direction and angle during drilling. In contrast, Rotary Steerable Systems provide real-time control and continuous adjustments, allowing for precise drilling paths without the need to stop drilling. Both systems find application in oil and gas exploration, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in reaching targeted reservoirs while minimizing non-productive time.</p></p>
