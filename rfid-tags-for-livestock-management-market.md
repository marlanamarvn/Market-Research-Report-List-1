<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The RFID Tags for Livestock Management Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Passive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>RFID tags for livestock management come in two main types: active and passive. Active RFID tags have their own power source, enabling them to transmit data over longer distances and providing real-time tracking of animals. This is especially useful for monitoring health and location. In contrast, passive RFID tags rely on external signals from RFID readers to function, making them more cost-effective but limited in range. Both types enhance livestock management by improving traceability, efficiency, and biosecurity.</p></p>
