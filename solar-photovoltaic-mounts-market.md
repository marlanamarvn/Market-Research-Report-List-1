<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Photovoltaic Mounts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tracking Mount</li><li>Fixed Mount</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The solar photovoltaic mounts market is primarily divided into two types: tracking mounts and fixed mounts. Tracking mounts adjust the solar panels' angle throughout the day to follow the sun's path, maximizing energy capture and improving efficiency. In contrast, fixed mounts are stationary and set at a specific angle, leading to simpler installation and lower costs, but offering less energy production compared to trackers. Both systems cater to different needs based on site conditions, budget, and energy requirements.</p></p>
