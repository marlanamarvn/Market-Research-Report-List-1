<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Alzheimer\'s Disease Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Donepezil</li><li>Memantine</li><li>Rivastigmine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Alzheimer's Disease market includes several key medications designed to manage symptoms and slow disease progression. Donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor, enhances cognitive function by increasing acetylcholine levels. Rivastigmine operates similarly, targeting both acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase, effective in mild to moderate stages. Memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, addresses more severe symptoms by regulating glutamate. Together, these treatments represent a critical focus for pharmaceutical development, aiming to improve quality of life for patients and support caregivers.</p></p>
